Study Group events are community events intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the events and in interactions online associated with Study Group.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Study Group events and discussions—instructors, helpers, organizers, and learners—is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout events, but you may also contact us privately; all communication will be treated as confidential.

## Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, choice of operating system, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be kind to others. Be aware of your words, and use language that is positive and community-building. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

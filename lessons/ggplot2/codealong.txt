### What is ggplot2? ###

ggplot2 is meant to be an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, hence gg-plot. The basic notion is that there is a grammar to the composition of graphical components in statistical graphics, and by direcly controlling that grammar, you can generate a large set of carefully constructed graphics tailored to your particular needs. Each component is added to the plot as a layer. 

### Components of a ggplot2 plot ###

Plots convey information through various aspects of their aesthetics. Some aesthetics that plots use are:

* x position
* y position
* size of elements
* shape of elements
* color of elements

The elements in a plot are geometric shapes, like

* points
* lines
* line segments
* bars
* text

Some of these geometries have their own particular aesthetics. For instance:

**points**

  * point shape
  * point size
  
**lines**

  * line type
  * line weight
  
**bars**

  * y minimum
  * y maximum
  * fill color
  * outline color
  
**text**

  * label value
